Hi, Iâ€™m Joakim Rosenfeldt

I'm the CEO of Mellonn, where we strive to make advanced AI solutions simple to use, for the average consumer!
Currently I'm developing in Flutter and using AWS to host a database and provide the AI solutions. The goal for Mellonn is to create our own AI solutions, and in the future run everything local, instead of using the cloud.
